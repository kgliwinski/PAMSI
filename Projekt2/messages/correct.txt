PI;1;Lost in the sky;
PI;6;Every day send future to past ;
PI;7;Every breath leaves me one less to my last Watch the sparrow falling ;
PI;9;I'll take seven lives for one And then my only father's ;
PI;4; This world is spinning around me ;
PI;5;This world is spinning without me ;
PI;2; Clouds roll by and I roll with them;
PI;3; Arrows fly Seas increase and then fall again;
PI;8;Gives new meaning to it all If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day ;
